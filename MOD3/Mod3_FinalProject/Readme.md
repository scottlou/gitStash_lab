## Prompt: 

Due to the pandemic, the government is looking for simple ways to identify people in need of stimulus checks and wants an idea of what characteristics about citizens they can use in the absence of having their recent tax returns and/or in the event that the person in works in an industry that has been severely impacted by the pandemic?

## Goal:

1. Analyze data set to identify different feature trends that would allow the government to identify what groups of people are most likely at risk for making ends meet (individuals making >less than 50k a year)
2. Build a binary classifier to predict whether a citizen makes more or less than 50k a year using the UCI census data set as a base.
